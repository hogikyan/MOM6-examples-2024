Test descriptions:

footloose_tests/: Breakup of two icebergs via the footloose mechanism, as described in [1]

collision_tests/: Two bonded-particle icebergs collide using either the original Kinematic Icebergs Dynamics (KID) bonded-particle model, KID with multiple-time-stepping (MTS), or the "improved" KID (iKID) that includes MTS with parallel-bond-style discrete element method (DEM) sub-steps (see [2]).

dem_cbeam_test/ and dem_ssbeam_test/: check whether iKID can match analytical solutions for beam bending

dem_ground_frac_test/: An iKID iceberg grounds and breaks into pieces

a68_test/: iKID simulation of the two rift-calving breakups of iceberg A68a in December 2020, from [2]


Each test contains python scripts to create the initial iceberg configuration (restart files) and to plot the results.
To build an appropriate conda environment:

conda env create --name icebergs --file=iceberg_env.yml
conda activate icebergs
