This is the simply supported beam test from Section 3.1 of Wang 2020 "A scale-invariant bonded particle model for simulating large deformation and failure of continua" https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compgeo.2020.103735. It tests the discrete-element/bonded-particle model that underlies iKID.

When the results are animated (animate_trajectories.py), the beam should bend into alignment with the plotted line.

By default, run with 4 PEs
