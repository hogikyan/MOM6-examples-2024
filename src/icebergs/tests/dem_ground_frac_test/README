A bonded-particle iceberg drifts east and collides with a seamount, fracturing (rift-calving) into fragments that drift away. Tests the iKID multiple-time stepping scheme with grounding, fracture, and interal sub-step forces evaluated using the parallel-bond discrete element method. Also tests the option 'use_broken_bonds_for_substep_contact' (see input.nml).

1. Make the iceberg input files: cd makeberg; ./RUN; cd ..
2.(optional) edit input.nml
3. run the model: ./RUN
4. animate the results: animate_trajectories.py
